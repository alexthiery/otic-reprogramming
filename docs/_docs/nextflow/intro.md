**Nextflow** is a language for pipeline development that is quickly becoming the gold standard for bioinformatics.

We use Nextflow for:

 - Developing pipelines to process a particular type (or types) of data.
 - Make our computational projects reproducible.

If you need a pipeline to process a particular type of data, please check [our nf-core wiki page](../nf-core) first. 

If there is no pipeline for your data in the nf-core collection, or you are setting up your own project (and hence need to organise your data processing in a reproducible way), then you will need to right some Nextflow code! 

**Please make sure you use the DSL2 syntax when conding in Nextflow!**


Please check out the following resources to get up and running with Nextflow: 

 1. [Full Nextflow course from Seqera Labs](https://seqera.io/training/)
 2. [Nextflow overall documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)
 3. [Nextflow DSL2 documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html)
 4. [Nextflow coding patterns](https://nextflow-io.github.io/patterns/index.html)
 5. [Nextflow blog](https://www.nextflow.io/blog.html)
 6. [Nextflow resources](https://nf-co.re/usage/nextflow) (links to the same resources as above, but also to Nextflow tutorials and instructions on how to run Nextflow in the cloud)
 
Also see [a very useful blog post](https://www.nextflow.io/blog/2019/easy-provenance-report.html) on how to track the provenance of results from a Nextflow pipeline.
