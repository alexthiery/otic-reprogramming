<p>I work to integrate neuroscience, medicine, computer science and public policy. If you like, you can follow me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}">@pesteadman</a>.</p>

<p>Periodically, I write stuff: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog">blog</a></p>

<p>Feel free to reach out for <strong>mentorship/advice</strong>. <em>This especially includes BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals</em>. I recognize I am still training myself, but I want to support those in earlier stages and/or considering these paths. I'll do my best to respond as soon as possible.</p>
