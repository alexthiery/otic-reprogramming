#### Selected list of courses:

A detailed description of my undergraduate program doesn’t exist anymore. This may be from funding cutbacks since my program typically struggled to attract enough students. For some reason the sound of Medical Physics just wasn't too appealing... So I have listed the courses I took after first year. The top three sections are courses required of the Medical and Health Physics curriculum (minus 1 or 2 electives in the Biological Sciences).
