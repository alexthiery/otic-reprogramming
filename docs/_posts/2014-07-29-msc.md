My thesis was a bit rushed as I was late deciding between going on to my PhD or graduating to pursue MD or MD/PhD studies. Ultimately the letter of acceptance made the decision for me. My thesis can be found in [t-space](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/42923/6/Steadman_Patrick_E_201311_MSc_thesis.pdf).

I was fortunate to join a great [lab](http://www.mouseimaging.ca) and work on some amazing projects. The first project I was a part of a study on how memory formation results in structural changes in the brain. The second project aimed to understand whether mutations in specific genes that have been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders alter brain morphology and to what extent they do.
